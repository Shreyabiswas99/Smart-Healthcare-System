# Smart Health care Predictor System
* The main feature of our smart healthcare system is to correctly predict the disease or health condition a person might be facing. For that it takes as input the age, and symptoms of the patients and runs a machine learning algorithm in the backend to predict the disease based on the patientâ€™s age, and symptoms they input.
* Predefined machine learning models for different types of diseases were used for our application. The datasets used to train and create these models were taken from Kaggle.
* The front end is implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It makes and designs the webpage of our application where the main prediction system is deployed.
* The backend uses Python programming language. Specifically, machine learning classifier models are implemented using scikit library and tensorflow. Furthermore, the backend development is handled by using the Flask web framework to create a user interface to input data in it.
* For a more detailed explanation, please look into the report inside the project.
